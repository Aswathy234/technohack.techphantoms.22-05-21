					<h3>GALLIPOT <br> "WE ARE HERE"</h3>
					<p>
						We establish  a portal for the
						collection of unused  medicine
						for further  utilization  by a
                        needy person.<br> 
                        Gallipot  drives 
                        the future of healthcare by 
                        connecting people with surplus 
                        medications. We enable health facilities and pharmacies to donate their unused medicines. Our system is built to ensure compliance and provide full liability protection.<br>
                        <h4>HOW IT WORKS??</h4>

 We directly accepts medicine from manufacturers, pharmacies, wholesalers, and health facilities. If you’re an individual with unused medicine to donate, you can donate through one of our partners.

You can also contribute to our cause with a monetary donation. Every little bit helps, and we appreciate your support.

We take surplus medications off of your hands and get them to the people who need them.<br>


<h5>WHY MEDICINE??</h5>

Because our health is a fundamental part of being human. Without it, we have nothing. 50 million Indians don’t take their prescribed medication because they can’t afford it.With soaring copays, deductibles, and insurance costs, many people are making impossible choices between medications, food and housing, gas to get to work, and more.


Not taking your medications, however, often leads to even worse outcomes—heart attacks, strokes, and even higher costs. This is our nation’s most critical problem, but it doesn’t have to be. 

That’s why we’re here. Gallipot provides access so everyone gets the care they deserve.
